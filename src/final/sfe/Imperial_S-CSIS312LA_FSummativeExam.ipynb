The N-gram size (unigram, bigram, trigram, etc.) will be provided as an input.\n","3. **Frequency Count:** For each N-gram generated, count its frequency in the text.\n","4. **Filter N-grams by Frequency:** The function should return only those N-grams whose frequency is above a certain threshold.\n","\n","## Requirements:\n","\n","- **Tokenization:** You must split the input text into tokens (words), ignoring punctuation and converting all words to lowercase.\n","- **Sliding Window:** The N-grams should be generated using a sliding window approach. For example, if the text is \"I love programming in Python\", a bigram (2-gram) would generate:\n"," - 'I love'\n"," - 'love programming'\n"," - 'programming in'\n"," - 'in Python'\n","- **Frequency Count:** For each generated N-gram, count how many times it appears in the text.\n","- **Filter by Frequency:** The function should accept an additional parameter min_count which specifies the minimum frequency for an N-gram to be included in the result.\n","\n","## Input:\n","\n","- **`text`** (str): A string of text, potentially with punctuation.
