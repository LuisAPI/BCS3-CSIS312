[SECTION]: TRAINING DATA

- Learning Objectives
    - define training data and its importance in NLP
    - understand the process of collecting and preparing data for NLP models
    - explore different training set data sets
    - identify challenges related to training data in NLP
    - apply best practices

- Preparing an NLP
    - high quality training data
        - ensuring that the quality is not compromised

- Training Data
    - is a type of data used for teaching new application, model or system to begin recognizing patters dependant on a project's requirements
    -- (in AI or ML) is slightly different, as they are labeled or annotated

    -- to find relationships, develop understanding, make decisions and evaluate their confidence when making a prediction

--- the better the training data, the better the model performs

- Types of annotations in NLP
    - utterances
        - refers to the smallest unit of speech or text that a speaker produces as a complete thought, typically separated by pauses in spoken language or punctuation in written.

        - for example:
            Can I have pizza?
            How is the weather in Dasma?
                -- these sentences represents single utterance

    - spoken language analysis
    - understanding customer reviews
        -- to properly breakdown or parse the input data into utterances

        The food was great | but | the service was slow. | I enjoyed the ambiance, | but | the waiter was not attentive |

        - this review covers the multiple ideas or utterances:
        - individual utterances
            - represents a distinct thought or sentiment
                - the food was great
                - the service was slow
                - I enjoyed the ambiance
                - the waiter was not attentive
            - parsing utterances
                - it help us ensures that each thought is analyzed separately more accurate insights from the text
        
        - Steps in Utterance Parsing for NLP tasks:
            - identify pauses or breaks
                - (in spoken language) pauses
                - (in written language) punctuation(. , ?) or conjunctions(but, and, or)
            - splitting text in utterances
                - use punctuation or logical breaks to split a sentence
                - to get individual utterance, each sentence can be treated as separate utterance if it expresses a complete idea
            - preprocessing for Machine Learning
                - tokenization is used to split text into words
                - stemming, removing stop words
                - analyzed the utterances separately for tasks like sentiment analysis, intent detection or topic modeling

        - Review:
        "The laptop is fast and efficient, but the battery life is terrible. I like the design but it is too heavy to carry around"

            - Parsed Utterances
                - the laptop is fast and efficient,
                - but the battery life is terrible.
                - I like the design but
                - it is too heavy to carry around.
            - Splitting Text
                - the laptop is fast and efficient
                - the battery life is terrible
                - I like the design
                - it is too heavy to carry around
            - Analyzed individually
                - sentiment
                    - identify the utterances:
                        - positive
                        - negative
                        - neutral
                - intent
                    - feature appreciation
                    - feature disappointment
            - customer review -> specific aspects
                - design
                - speed
                - battery life
                

Mini-Activity
Create a sentiment analysis using Twitter data through hands-on experience with data collection, preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

By the end of this activity, you should be able to explain the process and interpret the results effectively.
