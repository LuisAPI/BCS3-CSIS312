- markov model
    - mathematical framework used to describe systems that transition from state to another with a certain probability
        - markov property
            - asserts that the future state of a process depends only on its current state not on the sequence of events that preceded it
    -- state
        - represent the different possible conditions or situations in which a system can be
    -- transition probabilities
        - probabilities of moving from one state to another
    -- transition matrix
        - matrix that represents the transition probabilities between all pairs of state
    
    - example: weather prediction
        - states
            - sunny, rainy, cloudy
        - transition probabilities
            - sunny -> rainy
            - cloudy -> sunny
            - rainy -> cloudy

- bayes theorem
    - fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describe how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence

    - Event A
        - a person has a disease
    - Event B
        - a person tests positive for the disease
    - Hypothesis
        - to find the probability that a person has a disease given that they tested positive
    - Probable values:
        - prevalence of the disease (prior probability) - 0.01 (1%)
        - probability of testing positive given the disease (likehood) - 95%
        - probability of testing positive without the disease (false positive rate) - 5%

        P(B) - Probability of testing positive(marginal likelihood)
        P(B) = B(B | A). P(A) + P(B | -A). P(-A)
             = (0.95 x 0.01) + (0.05 x 0.99)
             = 0.059

        P(A|B)= 0.95 x 0.01/P(B)
              = 0.16
