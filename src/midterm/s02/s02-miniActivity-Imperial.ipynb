By implementing and modifying an n-gram model, students will observe how variations in input text and n-value affect the generated output. This hands-on experience will enhance their understanding of probabilistic text generation and the role of n-grams in natural language processing.\n","\n","## Objectives:\n","\n","1. To explore the concept of n-grams and their application in text generation.\n","2. To implement an n-gram model in Python with different sample texts and n-values.\n","3. To analyze and compare the results of text generation with various inputs and configurations.\n","\n","## Learning Outcomes:\n","\n","1. Students will be able to explain how n-grams are used in generating text.\n","2. Students will gain practical experience in coding and using n-gram models.\n","3. Students will understand how input text and n-value influence the generated text.\n","\n","**Background:** In natural language processing (NLP), n-grams are used to model sequences of words and predict subsequent words based on previous context. N-gram models are a fundamental technique in text generation, where the goal is to create new text that resembles a given sample. Understanding how different n-gram sizes and input texts affect the generated output is crucial for developing effective text generation models.\n","\n","*(cont.)*"],"metadata":{"id":"6dIRKu4a7Qlw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["*(cont.)*\n","\n","**Problem Statement:** You are tasked with exploring the behavior of n-gram models in text generation. Specifically, you need to:\n","\n","1. **Implement an n-gram Model:** Build a Python program that constructs an n-gram model from a given sample text. The program should handle various values of n to create models ranging from bigrams to higher-order n-grams.\n","\n","2. **Generate Text with Different Inputs:** Use the n-gram model to generate text based on different sample inputs. Compare the generated text for various n-values and observe how the choice of n and input text affects the output.\n","\n","3. **Analyze the Results:** Examine the coherence and relevance of the generated text. Identify any patterns or issues related to different n-gram sizes and sample texts. Assess how well the generated text reflects the structure and style of the input text.\n","\n","*(cont.)*"],"metadata":{"id":"qCHpwHTF7WT9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["*(cont.)*\n","\n","## Tasks:\n","\n","### 1. Create an n-gram Model:\n","- Implement a Python script that builds an n-gram model from a provided text. The script should handle varying sizes of n-grams (e.g., bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams).\n","\n","### 2. Generate and Compare Texts:\n","- Use the model to generate text sequences for different input texts. Experiment with different n-values and analyze how these affect the text output.\n","- Example inputs could be:\n"," - Text 1: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n"," - Text 2: \"Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods.\"\n","- Generate text sequences with various n-values (e.g., trigram, and 4-gram) for each input text.\n","\n","### 3. Evaluate and Discuss:\n","- Compare the quality of the generated text across different n-values.
