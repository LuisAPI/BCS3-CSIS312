[SESSION]: WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION (WSD)
Lesson Outcomes:
    - understand the concept of WSD and its importance to NLP
    - differentiate between the knowledge-based, supervised and unsupervised approaches
    - practice using python libraries(NLTK, WordNet) for basic WSD
    - discuss the significance of WSD in applications like search engines, translation systems and digital assistants
    - develop a simple WSD model and test its performance using provided dataset

Polysemy
    - it refers to words that have multiple meanings. These meanings can vary based on the context in which the word is used.

'bank' can refer to:
    - a financial institution
        - I deposited money in the bank
    - the side of the river
        - We sat a on the river bank and watched the waterflow

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
    - is the task of identifying which meaning (for sense) of a word is intended in a given context, this is important task in NLP because it significantly impacts the performance of different application such as:
        - machine translation
            - translating the correct sense of words is essential to avoid confusion
            - example:
                - time flies (literal or metaphorical)
        - information retrieval
            - search engines rely on WSD to provide accurate results for ambiguous terms
        - speech recognition
            - systems like Alexa or Siri need to understand ambiguous phrases correctly

Importance of WSD in NLP
    WSD plays a key role in several NLP tasks. including:
        - text classification
            - determines the sentiment or topic of a document requires understanding the context of ambiguous words
        - information extraction
            - system must extract relevant information and ignore irrelevant sense of a word
        - machine translation
            - choose the correct sense to ensure accurate translation across languages

Note: without the WSD, many NLP tasks can suffer in performance due to misinterpretation of words with multiple meanings

II. Approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation
    - knowledge-based methods
        - it relies on pre-existing lexical resources like WordNet
            - WordNet
                - a large lexical database of English that groups words into sets of synonyms and provides short definitions for each set
            - Lesk Algorithm
                - it allows to disambiguates a word by comparing the definitions of all possible senses of the word with the words in the context.
                --- the sense whose definition has the most overlap with the surrounding words is chosen
        
        
        - Lesk Algo
            - sentence: The bank on the river was overgrown with weeds
                - word sense: 'bank'
                    - financial institution
                        - a financial establishment for holding and managing money
                    - riverbank
                        - the sloping ground along the edge of a river
                - overlap of words in the context with the definitions indicates that the "riverbank" sense is the most appropriate
        
        - supervised learning approaches
            - in supervised approaches, labeled training data is used to train machine learning models to learn the correct sense of a word given the context
            - steps:
                - create a labeled dataset with words and their correct senses
                - training classifiers
                        - Naive Bayes
                        - Support Vector Machine
                - using these models to predict the sense of ambiguous words in new sentences
            - challenges:
                - requires large amounts of manually labeled data, which can be difficult to obtain
                - new words and senses may not be covered by the training data
        
        - unsupervised learning approaches
            - the unsupervised methods do not require labeled data. Instead,they attempt to discover word senses by clustering occurences of words based on their context
            - Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
                - is a technique that reduces the dimensionality of word vectors to uncover hidden patterns and group similar contexts
